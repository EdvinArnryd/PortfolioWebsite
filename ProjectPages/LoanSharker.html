            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="textSection">
                This little project was made to learn more about working with Unity and
                UI. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="contentSection sectionSpacing">
            <h2>Calculator</h2>
            <img src="../Assets/Images/LoanSharker/Calculator.png">
            <p class="textSection">
                The calculator is a very simple and almost fully functional system.
                It is a standard calculator that stores the last values and then 
                operates math functions based on the input. <br><br>

                All the buttons store a char that represent their value/input and
                this then goes through a check to either operate or add to the stored 
                value. <br><br>

                The calculator was never inteded to be used as a tool for the game,
                it is only there for immersion purposes. But it could of course be
                used for gameplay in the future.

            <h2>Calendar</h2>
            <img src="../Assets/Images/LoanSharker/Calendar.png">
            <p class="textSection">
                The calendar is used to remind the player what day it is. There was 
                also an idea that each day can have different notes and goals to 
                achieve, like when a deadline is due or something similar.

        <div class="contentSection sectionSpacing">
            <h2>For the Future</h2>
            <p class="textSection">
                The project did not make it very far. My main goal was to make the UI
                Look like an old mobile phone, and making a game out of it would be a
                big extra. However if I ever go back to this project, I would like to
                make some kind of investment system and a game loop where the player
                has different tasks to achieve per day.
