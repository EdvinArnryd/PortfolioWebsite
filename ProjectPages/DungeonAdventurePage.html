            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="textSection">
                Turn-based RPG made with Unity. This was the first game I made myself.
                I learned a lot of basics just scripting simple scripts and classes, basic
                project structure. I learned a lot from my mistakes. Planning the structure/architecture
                of the project is very important. I also learned that overscoping is very easy to do,
                and that you should plan better when making any project. I also learned that
                creating all assets by yourself is very time consuming, as I made all the assets myself...

            <p class="textSection">
                The hero class is what the player chooses at the start of the game.
                They can pick between 3 different classes, where each works a little
                differently than the other.

            <h2>Levels</h2>

            <p class="textSection">
                The level system in this game is made of the Map class. 
                The map is made of the Room class that is made into a 2d array.
                This enables the level to be 2d and the player can traverse the 
                level in 4 directions. The room class also stores data like descriptions
                which can tell the player different stories of the world. Some rooms
                are also special rooms, which has special effects like spawning a door
                or a shop merchant.

            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <img src="../Assets/Images/DA/Level1.png">
            <p class="textSection">
                The combat was a very basic Turn-based style. The player can
                attack, use spell and use potions. The enemy can use attack
                and heal themselves, where it is always random of what action
                they will perform.
                <br>
                <br>
                I made one script for the entire combat system. Each combat starts
                with the player's turn first. After the player used their action,
                a coroutine starts and performs the enemy's actions and displays
                the different movements until their action is over.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="textSection">
                Looking back at this project I can definitely tell that I 
                have learned a lot since I started the project. A lot of code
                is messy and not organized. It is missing a lot of Unity 
                code convention and structure. A lot of the code could be made
                into Scriptable Objects, like the the hero classes and items etc.
                And a lot of code could be made into components instead of making
                300 lines of the Player class.
